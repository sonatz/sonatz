# Hi there 👋, I'm Mason Achatz.
## I am a SecDevOps Engineer and Cloud Automation Specialist.
I have always had a passion for Automation and Application Development. Ever since a child intrigued by how things work, constantly tinkering and rebuilding my toys. Naturally this lead me from "hardware" to software engineering. My specialty is identifying business needs and delivering solutions.

## Skills and Experience:

* ⚛️ REACT JS
* 📱REACT Native
* 🖥 HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Mongo
* ∞ Security, Development, and Operations Specialist

### Identity and Access Management
Starting midway through a project can be challenging; changing project culture is a whole other bag. As the Lead SecDevOps Engineer I implemented a robust and secure delivery pipeline for rapid testing and deployments. Through my assessments, experience, and demonstrations I gained stakeholder buy-in, changing the development lifecycle and project delivery culture. Consequently, this reduced the project's technical debt exponentially.

### DEF7013
As the Cloud Integration Specialist and DevOps Engineer I was responsible for the design and implementation of AWS infrastructure for multi-node applications. I managed a multitude of AWS services to provide training, development, and pre-production environments.
